# About Me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, My name is Steven Winters, looking to further my skills as a Cloud Engineer. I've created a few projects and ready to become more of an expert within the Cloud and eventually be a hybrid Cloud Engineer.

## Interests:
- ðŸ‘€ What Iâ€™m interested in is Cloud computing and programming, my current goal is to gain an entry level position in the Cloud space and show what I'm capable of in a real job setting.
- I like joining communities to network and learn as much as possible because I'm so glad that I found something that I really like to do.

## Learning:
- ðŸŒ± I am AWS certified with a Cloud Practitioner, soon to be Solutions Architect Associate certified. I have many projects that I've completed over the pass few months and I'm building my skills with GitHub as well. 
- In addition to my learning, I'm trying to join as many communities as I can for learning. I'm currently doing #100daysofcloud to really gain confidence and familiarity in the cloud services. (I have a repo to showcase this journey as well). Check it out and give feedback!
