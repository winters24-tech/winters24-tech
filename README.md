# About Me:
- ðŸ‘‹ Good day, My name is Steven Winters and I'm a newbie to cloud computing/programming

## Interests:
- ðŸ‘€ What Iâ€™m interested in is Cloud computing/programming, my current goal is to gain an entry level position in the Cloud space and show what I'm capable of!
- I like joining communities to network and learn as much as possible because I'm so glad that I found something that I really like to do.

## Learning:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in a Cloud computing Boot Camp via JMU (James Madison University), and so far I've learned so much! Under CompTia I learned: CompTia Cloud+, Network+, A+, and Hardware and OS fundamentals. In the Cloud: AWS (Amazon Web Services) and MS Aure. Currently starting Linux and I'm excited! (I'll have a repo to showcase projects that I've worked on).
- In addition to my camp, I'm trying to join as many communities as I can for learning. I'm currently in #100daysofcloud and tacking on that journey. I have a repo to showcase that as well. Check it out and give feedback!
